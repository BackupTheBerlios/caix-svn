Welcome to CSP MiniCA LiveCD.

Please mount your writeable device (e. g. USB-stick) containing
the CA-data at  /mnt/ca  and the writeable device for exporting
certificates at  /mnt/cert_export.
If you choose other another mount points as  /mnt/ca  for your
CA-data, you must redefine the environment variable CSPHOME.
